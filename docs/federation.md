# Federation

The purpose of the federation feature is to allow you to create a single Unleash instance that can be shared across multiple clusters. This is useful if you have multiple environments that want to use Unleash, but you don't want to create a separate Unleash instance for environment.

```mermaid
graph LR
  pubsub[PubSub]

  subgraph Management Cluster
    mng-unleasherator[Unleasherator]
    mng-team-a-unleash[Unleash]
  end

  subgraph Dev Cluster
    dev-unleasherator[Unleasherator]
    dev-team-a-unleash-token[AdminApiToken]

    subgraph team-a-dev[Team Namespace]
      dev-team-a-unleash[RemoteUnleash]
    end
  end

  subgraph Prod Cluster
    prod-unleasherator[Unleasherator]
  end

  mng-team-a-unleash-.create.->mng-unleasherator

  mng-unleasherator-.publish.->pubsub
  pubsub-.subscribe.->dev-unleasherator
  pubsub-.subscribe.->prod-unleasherator

  dev-unleasherator-.create.->dev-team-a-unleash
  dev-unleasherator-.create.->dev-team-a-unleash-token

  dev-team-a-unleash-token-..->dev-team-a-unleash
```

In the example above we have three clusters: a management cluster, a dev cluster and a prod cluster. The management cluster is where the Unleash instance is created. The dev and prod clusters are where the teams are deploying their applications.

The management cluster has an Unleasherator instance that is responsible for creating the Unleash instance with a corresponding admin API token. The management Unleasherator publishes a message to a PubSub topic when it has created the Unleash instance along with the admin API token. The dev and prod clusters both have Unleasherator instances that are subscribed to the PubSub topic. When dev and prod Unleasherator instances receives the message, they creates a `RemoteUnleash` and an `AdminApiToken` resource in the correct namespace.
