# Unleasherator

Kubernetes operator for managing [Unleash](https://getunleash.io) - the open-source feature toggle service.

It has support for creating and managing Unleash instances and API tokens across multiple clusters or environments and only depends on Kubernetes native resources.

Used in production at the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV).

## Description

Unleasherator is a Kubernetes operator for managing Unleash instances and API tokens across multiple clusters or environments. It is built using the [Kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/) framework and is cloud and infrastructure agnostic.

You'll find the documentation for various Unleash resources in the [docs](./docs) directory.

* [Unleash](./docs/unleash.md)
* [ApiToken](./docs/apitoken.md)
* [RemoteUnleash](./docs/remoteunleash.md)

### Creating an Unleash instance

The following example can be used with [bitnami/postgresql][bitnami-postgresql] helm chart to create an Unleash instance with a local postgresql database.

[bitnami-postgresql]: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/postgresql

```yaml
apiVersion: unleash.nais.io/v1
kind: Unleash
metadata:
  name: unleash
spec:
  size: 1
  database:
    secretName: postgres-postgresql
    secretPassKey: postgres-password
    host: postgres-postgresql
    databaseName: postgres
    port: "5432"
    user: postgres
    ssl: "false"
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
    allowDNS: true
    extraEgressRules:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app.kubernetes.io/name: postgresql
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432
```

```

You can find more examples in the [config/samples](./config/samples) directory.

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/unleasherator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/unleasherator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run the controller in your cluster:

Since the controller needs to reach the Unleash instance it can not run locally, but must be deployed to the cluster.

```sh
make docker-build deploy logs
```

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs, and corresponding Helm charts using:

```sh
make generate manifests helm
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

### Metrics

There's prometheus metrics covering <https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/metrics-reference.html> the default set of kubebuilder provided performance gauges as well as additional metrics for deployment status.

| Metric                             | Type  | Description                        |
|------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------------|
| unleasherator_unleash_status       | Gauge | Status of Unleash instance         |
| unleasherator_remoteunleash_status | Gauge | Status of remote Unleash instances |
