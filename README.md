# Unleasherator

Kubernetes operator for managing [Unleash](https://getunleash.io) - the open-source feature toggle service.

Currently supports the following resources:

- [x] [Unleash](./docs/unleash.md)
- [x] [ApiToken](./docs/apitoken.md)
- [ ] [RemoteUnleash](./docs/remoteunleash.md)
- [ ] [Federation](./docs/federation.md)
- ~~[ ] Project~~*
- ~~[ ] Environment~~*

*These resources are not supported by the Unleash Open Source version and we don't have any plans to support them in this operator.

## Description

Unleasherator is a Kubernetes operator for managing Unleash instances and API tokens across multiple clusters or environments.

### Creating an Unleash instance

The following example can be used with [bitnami/postgresql][bitnami-postgresql] helm chart to create an Unleash instance with a local postgresql database.

[bitnami-postgresql]: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/bitnami/postgresql

```yaml
apiVersion: unleash.nais.io/v1alpha1
kind: Unleash
metadata:
  name: unleash
spec:
  size: 1
  database:
    secretName: postgres-postgresql
    secretPassKey: postgres-password
    host: postgres-postgresql
    databaseName: postgres
    port: "5432"
    user: postgres
    ssl: "false"
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true
    allowDNS: true
    extraEgressRules:
    - to:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app.kubernetes.io/name: postgresql
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5432
```

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/unleasherator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/unleasherator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing

// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run the controller in your cluster:

Since the controller needs to reach the Unleash instance it can not run locally, but must be deployed to the cluster.

```sh
make docker-build deploy logs
```

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs, and corresponding Helm charts using:

```sh
make generate manifests helm
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
